TODO:

- Bring up wasmtime / cranelift-wasm:
  - VMContext arg and `vmctx` global value
  - branch tables
  - separate jumptable and rodata sections; relocs between them

- ISA completeness:
  - ImmLogic: implement the algorithm to determine whether an immediate can be
    encoded as a logical immediate.
  - Add opcodes to lowering. Full integer/ALU instruction set.

- Calling conventions for non-SysV cases
  - Baldrdash: no prologue/epilogue; take this info in flags
  - audit for others

- Limits (handle gracefully / return error from lowering)
  - Jump offsets (19, 26-bit forms)

- Performance tests vs. SpiderMonkey WASM
  - make sure that cranelift-wasm can run (or wasmtime?)
  - compile benchmarks (Spec CPU? bzip2? rustfmt? tinycc?)
  - SM JS shell: ./js --wasm-compiler=ion
  - SM with Cranelift: ./js --wasm-compiler=cranelift

- API and naming cleanups
  - Add a "get input insn if we are its only use" method to LowerCtx
    - "conservative" version that does not look past loads/stores
  - rename conditional branch forms in arm64 akin to x64's revised naming
  - remove "inverted" flag in CondBrLowered in arm64
  - remove "CondBrLoweredCompound" entirely?
    - one-target form is just an optimization once we know block order, but
      two-target form can also be converted directly to machine code!
  - with_block_rewrites -> map_blocks
  - with_fallthrough_block -> set_fallthrough_block
  - with_block_offsets -> map_blocks_to_offsets

- misc fixups
  - Ensure that clobbered reg saves in ARM64 ABI consider register class

- Post-MVP:

  - Partition code by side-effects and permit some reordering: e.g., loads
    incorporated into their uses if not crossing other memory ops
    (see: libVEX's side-effect partitioning)

  - better block reordering: heuristically place after `from` or before `to` if
    only one out-edge or in-edge respectively (?). Or split the compound
    condbr/br and put one crit edge between the branches.

  - VCode (re)design:
    - allow edits (insertions, deletions, block reorder) alongside instruction list
    - rework lowering and VCodeBuilder: single forward pass; delete insns when
      unused

  - VCode as arch-independent input:
    - side-table: single-def for a given register use?
    - put Cranelift IR opcodes/instructions into VCode container

  - Handle out-of-range branches and constant-pool references (out of imm19
    range at least)

  - Better isel for:
    - pre-indexed / post-indexed addressing
    - Load-pair / store-pair

  - Debug info / source-maps

  - Stack maps

-------


Milestones:

- (X) M0: codegen a leaf function (no calls) with only integer add/sub, load/store,
  and control flow. No prologue or epilogue.

- (X) M1: function ABI. Support function arguments and return value. Save clobbered
  registers.

- M2: fill out the integer instruction set. Support all Cranelift ops that are
  not FP or vector-related, in leaf functions.

- M2.5: Support calls to other functions, saving caller-saved regs.

- M3: full Cranelift instruction set support.
